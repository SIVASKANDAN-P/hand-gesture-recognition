# Hand-gesture-recognition
You are working as a data scientist at a home electronics company which manufactures state of the art smart televisions.

The gestures are continuously monitored by the webcam mounted on the TV. Each gesture corresponds to a specific command:

1. Thumbs up:  Increase the volume
2. Thumbs down: Decrease the volume
3. Left swipe: 'Jump' backwards 10 seconds
4. Right swipe: 'Jump' forward 10 seconds  
5. Stop: Pause the movie
